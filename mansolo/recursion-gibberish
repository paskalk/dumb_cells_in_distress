Hello bro.How are you doing today hope fine.Please I had this problem in the algorithm reexam and was unable to solve it and i have a complementary session for the exam on monday.Can you help me provide a solution for this_I would really appreciate.Thanks
   Consider the following recursive function f(x,y) with two positive integers x and y:
S(x) = x + 1;
f(x,0) = 0;
f(x,S(y)) = g(f(x,y), x);
g(x,0) = x;
g(x,S(y)) = S(g(x,y));
Your task is to:
- calculate the values of f(5, 4) and f(4, 3);
- find out what the function f(x,y) does;
- calculate big Oh for large N
Provide detailed steps to solve the problem, i.e. detailed calculations of recursion, the
reasoning of the result, method for calculating big Oh.
No points will be given to answers without detailed steps.

function s(x) {
  return x + 1;
}

function f(x, m) {
  if (m == 0) return 0;
  
  // m = S(y)
}

function fOfN(x, y) {
  n = S(y);  
  f(x, n)
}

function g(x, n) {
  if (n == 0) return x;
  
  // n = s(y) = s(g(x, y))
}
